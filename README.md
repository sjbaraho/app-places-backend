# Project Overview
This project is the back-end REST API of an app that lets users create an account and share places with other users. A user who is not logged in can view all other users and view their locations and look at the locations on a map but they are unable to edit these locations. A logged-in user can view all other users and their places but can also share, edit, and delete their own places. The backend-end was built using Javascript with Mongoose, ExpressJS and NodeJS. This backend is connected to a MongoDB database. It also uses the Google Maps Geocoding API to get the coordinates for addresses entered on the front-end. This REST API utilizies CRUD for both users and places. It also includes extensive error handling, using JWT for authentication and authorization, and handles image uploads. The front-end application codebase utilizing this REST API can be found at https://github.com/sjbaraho/app-places
